# Howdy!

I am Lucas, a full-stack web dev from Goiás, Brazil, exploring the limits of JavaScript, one node_module at a time. Adept at writing clean, reusable, and updatable code, I build simple applications that solve complex problems.
<br>
Between one code and the next I watch bad movies and main Mercy in Overwatch 2. Want to talk about tech (or something random), a movie suggestion, help/collab on a project, heals in OW2, and/or hire me? Please do get in touch.

<br>**Attention:** starting on Nov 28th, 2022, [Heroku will no longer offer free hosting services](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter) and the Dead-by-API will no longer be live. However, the source code for the API and the database schema are, and always will be, free and available for you to download, improve upon, and have fun with. If you happen to feel like it, give me a shout-out on your project. It will make my day to see someone using this code.
